## Contributing

You'd like to contribute to my portfolio repo? I'm flattered. While this repository is specifically geared to showing my work, there are a couple of really great ways to contribute:

## Reporting Bugs

See something that doesn't look or work the way it should? Please feel free to open an issue on the topic. Including helpful information like what OS and browser you're using, steps you took that produced the problem, what you expected to see and why, and any applicable screenshots or GIFs will help ensure I can address the issue and properly resolve it.

## Suggesting Enhancements

Think there's some cool feature that a project should be able to do? Awesome! Open an issue and describe what the enhancement is and why it would be useful.
